# goSnake
Cheesy snake game implemented using GLFW and Go

This was hacked together over a day or so, so there's lots of unused code, but it basically works!

## Build Instructions.

```
$ go get -u github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.2/glfw 
$ go get -u github.com/go-gl/gl/v2.1/gl 
$ go build main.go
$ ./main
```

## Credits.

* The wonderful folks at [go-gl](https://github.com/go-gl)

* The creators of Go for giving me something to do.
